# Astropi - Let's make a better doc ü™ê

Astropi is a free and open-source project that helps you build beautiful and accessible API documentation for your projects. It's built with Astro, a fast and modern Static Site Generator.

## üöÄ How to use Astropi

Create a new Astropi project by running the following command:

```bash
# If you use npm
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
# If you use yarn
yarn create astro@latest --template starlight
# If you use pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

Or add Astropi to an existing Astro project:

```bash
# If you use npm
npx astro add starlight
# If you use yarn
yarn astro add starlight
# If you use pnpm
pnpm astro add starlight
```


From there, read the generated `README.md` in your new project, or check out the [Astropi documentation](https://astropi.dev) for more information.
