The first alpha version of Astropi has just been released on NPM. To try it out on a new project, all you need is one command:

```bash
# If you use pnpm
pnpm create astro --template github:goulvenclech/astropi/starter
# If you use npm
npm create astro --template github:goulvenclech/astropi/starter
# If you use yarn
yarn create astro --template github:goulvenclech/astropi/starter
```

## Astropi is an Astro Integration

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a fast and modern [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator). You can read [this article from my blog](https://goulven-clech.dev/2023/launching-blog-astro), which explains in detail how Astro works, how it stands out from the competition, and why it's the perfect choice for beginners.

Astropi is build on top of Astro, it's both a starter template and a set of components, styles, and utilities that help you build beautiful and accessible API documentation for your projects. All you need to do is install Astropi, writes a few lines of setup, and start writing your documentation.

Unlike the majority of templates, where the user clone a whole project and build on top of it, Astropi is an Astro Integration. The [Integrations API](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/integrations-reference) allows us to hook into the Astro build process and inject our own custom logic, like adding routes, modifying the Astro config, etc.

This way, the user has a very clean project structure, with most boilerplate code abstracted away, and can focus on writing the documentation. 

## Bug in production

If this first alpha version works fine in development mode, there is a breaking bug in production.

During build, Astro merge routes that use the same component, preventing us to create multiples collections from the same archetype. I have documented this issue in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/10622) and currently working on [a fix](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/10625). Stay tuned for the next release!

## Current features

This first alpha version of Astropi mostly serves as a proof of concept. But it includes the following features:

- **Custom collections**, create your own collections from Astropi's archetype.

- **Blog Content archetype**, create a functional blog from markdown files.

- **Header Navigation**, display link to your collections.
